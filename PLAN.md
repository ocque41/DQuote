# SPRINT 0 PLAN

## Item 1: Baseline Next.js + shadcn scaffold verification
- Confirm the repo already satisfies the baseline scaffold (Next.js App Router with Tailwind and shadcn integration) and note any fixes if missing.

### Acceptance Criteria
- [x] `src/app` structure exists with an index route rendering without runtime errors.
- [x] `pnpm dev` boots cleanly (no type errors) and the home page renders a placeholder view.

## Item 2: Dependency baseline and documentation
- Ensure required dependencies (zod, React Hook Form, Prisma, Stripe, Puppeteer, TanStack Query) are present and document the verification steps in README.

### Acceptance Criteria
- [x] `package.json` lists all required libraries with compatible versions.
- [x] README includes up-to-date instructions to install dependencies and run the dev server.
