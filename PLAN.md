# SPRINT 3 PLAN

## Item 1: Eliminate remaining binary assets blocking PRs
- Identify and remove any lingering binary artifacts (e.g., default favicons) from the repository so GitHub PRs accept the diff.

### Acceptance Criteria
- [x] All binary assets (ico/svg/png/etc.) are deleted from tracked sources, confirmed via `git ls-files` inspection.
- [x] `pnpm lint` passes after asset removal, ensuring no references remain.

## Item 2: Document binary-free status for contributors
- Update project docs with guidance on avoiding binary commits and noting removal of default favicon.

### Acceptance Criteria
- [x] README includes a note on the no-binary requirement and favicon removal.
- [x] `git status` is clean after documentation updates.
